# HTML Accessibility Bad Practices Examples

This repository contains 10 examples of HTML documents that intentionally demonstrate bad practices in web accessibility. These examples are designed for educational purposes to highlight common mistakes and incorrect implementations of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG).

## Purpose
The purpose of these examples is to help developers, designers, and accessibility advocates identify and understand accessibility issues in HTML documents. By studying these examples, you can learn how to avoid these mistakes and create more inclusive and accessible web content.

## Examples Overview
Each folder contains an `index.html` file with specific accessibility issues. Below is a brief description of the types of issues demonstrated in each example:

1. **Example 1**: Basic accessibility mistakes, such as missing `alt` attributes and improper heading structure.
2. **Example 2**: Incorrect use of ARIA roles and missing form labels.
3. **Example 3**: Poor color contrast and missing skip links.
4. **Example 4**: Misuse of ARIA roles and non-descriptive link text.
5. **Example 5**: Missing captions for multimedia content and improper keyboard navigation.
6. **Example 6**: Placeholder text used instead of labels and vague link text.
7. **Example 7**: Missing focus indicators and redundant ARIA roles.
8. **Example 8**: Tables without headers or captions and autoplaying media without controls.
9. **Example 9**: Non-descriptive page titles and improper use of semantic elements.
10. **Example 10**: Misleading `alt` text, poor keyboard navigation, and missing language attributes.

## How to Use
1. Navigate to the folder of the example you want to explore.
2. Open the `index.html` file in a browser or code editor.
3. Review the code and identify the accessibility issues.
4. Compare the issues with WCAG success criteria to understand what went wrong.

## Disclaimer
These examples are intentionally designed to demonstrate bad practices and should not be used as templates for production websites. Always follow WCAG guidelines and test your web content for accessibility.
